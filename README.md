This script is designed to create a Node.js project structure with specified folders and files, initialize npm project, add scripts to `package.json`, install dependencies, and create database class and app.js files based on provided syntax.

  

## Usage

To run the script, execute the following command:

  

    npx config-node-app "$(pwd)"

  

By default script is creating server folder if want to add new folder use as follow

The script provided automates the setup process for creating a new Node.js project by addressing several common tasks and challenges developers face during project initialization. Here are the key issues it solves:

  

Boilerplate Setup: Setting up a new Node.js project involves creating a directory structure, initializing npm, setting up configuration files, and installing dependencies. Manually performing these tasks can be time-consuming and error-prone. The script automates these steps, ensuring a consistent and standardized project setup every time.

  

Directory Structure: Organizing project files and directories according to best practices is essential for maintainability and scalability. The script creates a predefined directory structure for the project, including folders for controllers, routes, models, configurations, middleware, services, and utilities. This ensures that developers have a clear and consistent layout for organizing their code.

  

Configuration Files: Many Node.js projects require configuration files, such as .env files for environment variables and package.json for npm configuration. The script creates these files with appropriate default settings, saving developers from manually creating and configuring them.
